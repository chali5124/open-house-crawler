# open-house-crawler
Python framework for crawling and parsing property info for uploading to OpenHouse

This code does work, but needs a bit more TLC from me before it's ready for primetime.  If you're interested in working on this, please email me at kyle@dataskeptic.com.  Otherwise, I'll start adding to our Waffle board when this is a bit more production ready.
